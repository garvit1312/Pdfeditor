# Pdfeditor
Description: Developed a Python-based PDF editor using Jupyter Notebook that allows users to edit PDF files by converting each page into an image, editing the image, and converting it back to PDF. The project automates the process of separating, editing, and saving PDF pages efficiently.

Key Features:

    Allows users to select a PDF file from their device for editing.
    Separates PDF into individual pages and converts them into images.
    Saves the images in a specified folder and displays them one by one.
    Provides options to edit each image in MS Paint by clicking on an 'Edit' button.
    After editing, users can save changes and move to the next page with 'Save and Next'.
    Once all pages are edited, the tool displays a message indicating "No more pages to edit".
    Offers a final option to convert all edited images back into a single PDF file.
